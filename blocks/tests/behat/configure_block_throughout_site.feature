Feature: Add and configure blocks throughout the site
  In order to maintain some patterns across all the site
  As a manager
  I need to set and configure blocks throughout the site

  @javascript
  Scenario: Add and configure a block throughtout the site
    Given the following "courses" exists:
      | fullname | shortname | category |
      | Course 1 | C1 | 0 |
    And the following "users" exists:
      | username | firstname | lastname | email |
      | manager1 | Manager | 1 | manager1@asd.com |
    And the following "system role assigns" exists:
      | user | course | role |
      | manager1 | Acceptance test site | manager |
    And I log in as "manager1"
    And I follow "Turn editing on"
    And I add the "Comments" block
    And I open the "Comments" blocks action menu
    And I follow "Configure Comments block"
    And I fill the moodle form with:
      | Page contexts | Display throughout the entire site |
    And I press "Save changes"
    When I follow "Course 1"
    Then I should see "Comments" in the "Comments" "block"
    And I should see "Save comment" in the "Comments" "block"
    And I am on homepage
    And I open the "Comments" blocks action menu
    And I follow "Configure Comments block"
    And I fill the moodle form with:
      | Default weight | -10 (first) |
    And I press "Save changes"
    And I follow "Course 1"
    # The first block matching the pattern should be top-left block
    And I should see "Comments" in the "//*[@id='region-pre' or @id='block-region-side-pre']/descendant::div[contains(concat(' ', normalize-space(@class), ' '), ' block ')]" "xpath_element"
