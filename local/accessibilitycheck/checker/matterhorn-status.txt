Done = This point of the protocol is verified
Doable = This point of the protocol could probably be verified, but is not done at the moment
Unsupported = This point of the protocol will for sure never be verified, or at least not within the frame of the semester project. It is too complicated, or I need a much more substancial background in order to be able to do something for it.
Unknown = This point of the protocol may be verifiable or not, I don't know; I haven't yet all the required background, or haven't yet read enough documentations to know or decide
